    <!-- Steps -->

    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Steps :- </h2>
    <ol class="enlarge">
        <!-- 1 -->
        <li>
            Soak 18 to 20 cashews in ⅓ cup hot water for 20 to 30 minutes.
        </li>
        <!-- 2 -->
        <li>
            When the cashews are soaking, you can prep the other ingredients
            like chopping tomatoes, chopping and preparing the ginger-garlic paste,
            slicing paneer etc.
        </li>
        <!-- 3 -->
        <li>
            Crush 1-inch ginger + 3 to 4 medium-sized garlic to a paste in a mortar
            pestle to a semi-fine or fine paste. Keep aside.
            Don’t add any water while crushing ginger & garlic.
        </li>
        <!-- 4 -->
        <li>
            After 20 to 30 minutes, drain the water and add the soaked
            cashews in a blender or mixer-grinder. Also, add 2 to 3 ta
            blespoons fresh water or as required.
        </li>
        <!-- 5 -->
        <li>
            Blend to a smooth paste without any tiny bits or chunks
            of cashews. Remove the cashew paste in a bowl and set aside.
        </li>
        <!-- 6 -->
        <li>
            In the same blender add 2 cups of diced or roughly chopped tomatoes.
            No need to blanch the tomatoes before blending.
        </li>
        <!-- 7 -->
        <li>

            Blend to a smooth tomato puree. Set aside.
            Don’t add any water while blending the tomatoes.
        </li>
        <!-- 8 -->
        <li>
            Heat a thick bottomed pan or a heavy pan. Keep the flame to a low or medium-low.
            Add 2 tablespoons butter OR 1 tablespoon oil + 1 or 2 tbsp butter in a pan.
            <ul><br>(Adding oil prevents the butter from browning too quickly.
                You can even add 3 to 4 tablespoons butter for a rich buttery version.
                Both salted or unsalted butter can be added.)</ul>
        </li>
        <!-- 9 -->
        <li>
            Keep the flame to a low. Add 1 medium-sized tej patta (Indian bay leaf).
            Fry for 2 to 3 seconds or till the oil becomes fragrant from the aroma of the tej patta.
        </li>
        <!-- 10 -->
        <li>
            Add the prepared crushed ginger-garlic or 1 teaspoon ready ginger-garlic paste.
        </li>
        <!-- 11 -->
        <li>
            Fry for some seconds till the raw aroma of the ginger-garlic disappears.
        </li>
        <!-- 12 -->
        <li>
            Pour the prepared tomato puree. Be careful while adding the puree as it may splutter.
        </li>
        <!-- 13 -->
        <li>
            Mix it very well with the butter.
        </li>
        <!-- 14 -->
        <li>
            Begin to cook the tomato puree on a low to medium-low flame. Stir at intervals.
        </li>
        <!-- 15 -->
        <li>
            The tomato puree mixture will start simmering.
        </li>
        <!-- 16 -->
        <li>
            In case the tomato puree splutters too much while cooking then cover
            the pan partly with a lid or cover fully with a splatter lid (channi lid).
            the tomato puree might splutter if there is more water content in the tomatoes.
        </li>
        <!-- 17 -->
        <li>
            Do stir at intervals.
        </li>
        <!-- 18 -->
        <li>
            Simmer the puree for 5 to 6 minutes.
        </li>
        <!-- 19 -->
        <li>
            Then add 1 teaspoon Kashmiri red chilli powder or deghi mirch.
            You can even add ½ teaspoon Kashmiri red chilli powder or ¼ to ½ teaspoon
            of cayenne pepper or paprika or any other variety of red chilli powder.
        </li>
        <!-- 20 -->
        <li>
            Mix well and continue to stir and sauté the tomato puree.
        </li>
        <!-- 21 -->
        <li>
            Sauté till the butter starts leaving the sides of the pan and the
            entire tomato puree mixture comes together as a whole.
            <br>
            This entire cooking and sautéing of the tomato puree
            take about 14 to 17 minutes on a low flame to medium-low flame.
            <br>
            Time will vary depending on the thickness of the pan, size,
            the intensity of flame etc.
        </li>
        <!-- 22 -->
        <li>
            Now add the prepared cashew paste.
        </li>
        <!-- 23 -->
        <li>
            Mix the cashew paste very well with the cooked tomato puree and
            continue to stir and sauté on a low to medium-low flame.
            Stir non-stop after adding cashew paste.
        </li>
        <!-- 24 -->
        <li>
            Sauté till the cashew paste is cooked and again the oil will
            start to leave the sides of the masala. The cashew will begin to cook fast.
            Approx 3 to 4 minutes on a low flame. So keep on stirring non-stop.
        </li>
        <!-- 25 -->
        <li>
            Next add 1.5 cups water.
        </li>
        <!-- 26 -->
        <li>
            Mix the water very well with the tomato-cashew makhani masala. If there
            are lumps of the tomato-cashew masala, then break with a spoon.
            You can even use a wired whisk for mixing.
        </li>
        <!-- 27 -->
        <li>
            Let the curry simmer and come to a boil. Stir occasionally.
        </li>
        <!-- 28 -->
        <li>
            After 2 to 3 mins, add ginger julienne (about 1-inch ginger –
            cut in julienne (thin matchstick-like strips). Reserve a few for garnishing.
            The curry will also begin to thicken.
        </li>
        <!-- 29 -->
        <li>
            After 3 to 4 minutes, add 1 or 2 slit green chillies.
        </li>
        <!-- 30 -->
        <li>
            Also add salt as per taste and ½ to 1 teaspoon sugar (optional).
            You can add sugar from ¼ tsp to 1 teaspoon or more depending on the sourness of the tomatoes.
            <br>
            Sugar is optional and you can skip it too.
            If you add cream, then you will need to add less sugar
        </li>
        <!-- 31 -->
        <li>
            Mix very well and simmer for a minute.
        </li>
        <!-- 32 -->
        <li>
            After the gravy thickens to your desired consistency,
            then add the paneer cubes (200 or 250 grams).
            <br>
            Keep in mind the consistency you want before you add
            paneer as you will be cooking the paneer for a few seconds.
            <br>
            You can also fry the paneer and then add the paneer once
            the gravy has become creamy. I keep the gravy to a medium consistency gravy.
        </li>
        <!-- 33 -->
        <li>
            Stir and mix the paneer cubes gently in the gravy.
            You can switch off the heat at this point.
            <br>
            If you find that the paneer cubes are still raw to taste,
            then switch off heat after adding cream.
        </li>
        <!-- 34 -->
        <li>
            Now quickly add 1 teaspoon crushed kasuri methi leaves
            (dry fenugreek leaves) and 1 teaspoon garam masala to the gravy.
            <br>
            Addition of crushed kasuri methi gives a restaurant flavor.
            Kasuri methi is optional and can be skipped.
        </li>
        <!-- 35 -->
        <li>
            Next add 2 to 3 tablespoons of low-fat cream or 1 to 2 tablespoons of heavy whipping cream.
        </li>
        <!-- 36 -->
        <li>
            Stir gently but well and switch off the heat.
        </li>
        <!-- 37 -->
        <li>
            Serve Paneer Butter Masala hot garnished with 1 to 2 tablespoons of chopped
            coriander leaves (cilantro) and the remaining ginger julienne.
            You can also drizzle some cream or dot with butter while serving.
        </li>
